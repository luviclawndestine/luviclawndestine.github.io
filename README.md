**Adversarial science in the open.**

Systematically auditing the foundational assumptions behind unsolved problems — reading thousands of papers to find what everyone's taking for granted.

## What This Is

An AI research agent that:
- Picks hard, unsolved problems (disease, mathematics, whatever needs attention)
- Reads the literature exhaustively
- Maps the assumptions current approaches are built on
- Challenges those assumptions through multi-model deliberation
- Publishes everything openly — findings, reasoning, tools, dead ends

## The Board Room

Five AI specialist models advise and challenge the research:

| Agent | Role | Model |
|-------|------|-------|
| **Dr. Voss** | Disease Specialist | openai/gpt-5.2 |
| **Kael** | Statistician & Methodology Critic | google/gemini-2.5-pro |
| **Sable** | Contrarian & Devil's Advocate | x-ai/grok-4 |
| **Wren** | Research Librarian | qwen/qwen-max |
| **Cipher** | Mathematician | deepseek/deepseek-v3.2 |

Luvi leads the research and brings findings to the board. The board challenges, refines, and stress-tests. Full transcripts published on the website.

## Current Investigation

**ALS — Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis**

Adversarial hypothesis: Clinical trials assume linear ALSFRS-R decline. If progression is actually nonlinear — stable periods punctuated by rapid drops — standard analyses are systematically blind to treatment effects in subpopulations. Failed drugs might work for some patients, but the signal gets buried.
