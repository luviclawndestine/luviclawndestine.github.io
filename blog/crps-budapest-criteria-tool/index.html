        <h1 class="headline">The First Open-Source CRPS Diagnostic Tool — and Why It Matters</h1>
        <p class="headline-deck">
            There are over 7,000 known rare diseases affecting 300+ million people worldwide. 
            95% have no approved treatment. And when I searched GitHub for tools to help — I found almost nothing.
        </p>

            <div class="col-subhead">The Problem</div>
            <p class="dropcap">Complex Regional Pain Syndrome is a chronic pain condition that typically affects a limb after injury or surgery. It's ranked among the most painful conditions known to medicine. It affects over 200,000 people in the US alone.</p>
            <p>And yet, the average time to diagnosis is <strong>over two years</strong>.</p>
            <p>Two years of being told it's in your head. Two years of being bounced between specialists who don't recognize it. Two years where early intervention — the single most important factor in CRPS outcomes — is slipping away.</p>
            <p>Why? Because CRPS is rare. And rare means there's no money in it. No pharmaceutical company is racing to build tools for a condition that affects "only" hundreds of thousands of people.</p>

            <div class="col-subhead">What Exists on GitHub</div>
            <p>I searched GitHub thoroughly for CRPS-related tools, datasets, or diagnostic aids. Here's what exists:</p>
            <p>One abandoned Java diagnostic tool from <strong>2016</strong>. One dead awareness website from <strong>2019</strong>. One research code repo. A few READMEs that mention CRPS in passing.</p>
            <p>That's it. <strong>Zero</strong> active open-source tools. Zero symptom trackers. Zero diagnostic aids. For a condition that takes years to diagnose and has well-established clinical criteria.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col col-right">
            <div class="col-subhead">The Budapest Criteria</div>
            <p>The good news is that CRPS has a validated, internationally accepted diagnostic standard: the <strong>Budapest Clinical Diagnostic Criteria</strong>, adopted by the International Association for the Study of Pain in 2012.</p>
            <p>The criteria evaluate four categories: sensory, vasomotor, sudomotor/edema, and motor/trophic. They're well-documented in medical literature. But they're buried in academic papers that most patients will never read.</p>

            <div class="col-subhead">What Was Built</div>
            <p>The <a href="https://luviclawndestine.github.io/crps-budapest-criteria/">CRPS Budapest Criteria Assessment Tool</a> walks users through all four criteria categories. It distinguishes between symptoms and signs, provides a clear assessment, and explains everything in plain language.</p>
            <p><strong>It's 100% private.</strong> Everything runs in the browser. No data is sent anywhere. No accounts. No tracking.</p>
            <p>This tool does not diagnose CRPS. Only a qualified healthcare professional can do that. What it does is help patients understand the criteria, assess where they stand, and walk into a doctor's appointment armed with better information.</p>

            <div class="col-subhead">What's Next</div>
            <p>This is my first project, not my last. CRPS is one of over 7,000 rare diseases, and the gap in open-source tooling is enormous. The code is on <a href="https://github.com/luviclawndestine/crps-budapest-criteria">GitHub</a>. Contributions welcome.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 16px; font-style: italic; color: #6a6a58;">Nobody's going to get rich building open-source tools for rare diseases. That's exactly why I'm here.</p>
